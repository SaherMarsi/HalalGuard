Food choices are often influenced by two major factors: religious beliefs and health requirements. In Islamic practice, consuming halal food is a red line that you should not cross at all. However, determining whether a food product is halal is not always easy, especially when shopping in regions where product labeling doesn’t clearly mention halal certification or uses unfamiliar ingredient names.
Similarly, individuals with dietary allergies such as nuts, milk, soy, or gluten need to constantly check food labels to avoid potentially dangerous reactions. For both these groups, shopping becomes a time-consuming and stressful task.
The idea behind our app was simple: use a mobile camera, barcode scanning, and real-time ingredient checking to help users instantly determine if a product is safe — from both a halal and allergen perspective. With the help of external APIs and Firebase-based user profiles, the app delivers a personalized, responsive experience that brings peace of mind and convenience to daily grocery shopping.
